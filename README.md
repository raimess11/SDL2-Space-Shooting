# SDL2 Arcade Space Shooting Project
## Simple Retro Arcade Space Shooter
A classic retro-style space shooter game built entirely from scratch as a learning project (at **Dec 2024**). This game was developed without any game engine, focusing on understanding the fundamentals of game development at a low level. All core systems — including collision detection, input handling, object movement, and rendering — were implemented manually using SDL2.

## 🔧 Built From Scratch
This project emphasizes learning and implementing the essential building blocks of a 2D game:
* Custom collision detection for player, enemy ships, and projectiles
* Input handling using SDL2 to manage smooth player movement and shooting controls
* Rendering pipeline using SDL2 to draw the player ship, enemies, bullets, and background elements
* Basic game loop implementation (update → render → repeat)
